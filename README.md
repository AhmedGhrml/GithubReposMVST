# Description

This project lets you type a github username and look up for its repositories and search for an exact repository


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Future Improvements
I would like to enhance the UI more since it's pretty much simple , nothing fancy.


### Feedback about the exercise
I HAD FUN! , I mean , the exercise is quite simple , yet it's challenging , I had fun working with React , I faced some bugs (Obviously xD) , but that's our job as developers right? :'D , but to be honest , I loved the exercice and I hope you like my work!
